# lewlews-rock-paper-scissors
A little game I made to practice my JS skills a few years back. This game goes a little further than randomly picking 1 of 3 possibilities!

While I was writing this game, I discovered that there is -- believe it or not -- an entire strategy behind playing Rock Paper Scissors. It's true! For exmaple, if a player is losing and getting desperate, logic and psychology says that there is a 75% chance a human will choose Rock because it resembles strength and bruteness, or if a player makes the same selection twice, they are very unlikely to select the same choice a third time.

My A.I will take advantage of these Human predictions by setting what I have called "modifiers". These modifiers will alter the AI's behaviour based on prediction.

Okay don't expect Alexa or Google! I was just a guy learning JavaScript at the time! But this was a really fun and exciting challenge I set myself; creating a very basic A.I.

The game does not utilise any fancy node modules or gulp, it is all just raw code I wrote one afternoon.

## Modifiers

You can see the A.I modifiers in game.js from lines 166 - 206.

I have described the psychological theory behind each of these modifiers.

## Note:

There are few end game bugs in this game so you might need to sometimes refresh the window when your game is over. I never quite got the time to fix this bug. :-( Perhaps one day I can get round to also polishing the design up a bit. Of course this is all open to the world so feel free to jump in!
